Features:-
Building User Authentication Service: Modern applications rely on user authentication,Token-based authentication is a protocol which allows users to verify their identity, and in return receive a unique access token. During the life of the token, users then access the website or app that the token has been issued for.Tokens offer a second layer of security, and administrators have detailed control over each action and transaction.

Using Rest API to populate the bookstore:We will use the Book API  to have a real database for the search.  Book API is intended to write applications that can interact with the Books API. The Books API is a way to search and access that content, as well as to create and view personalization around that content.

Implementing the list all books feature: When  our service is ready to make an API call,.We will call the rest endpoint “https://localhost:8080/allbooks” and it will list all the books .
 
Implementing the search feature: When  our service is ready to make an API call, connect out search input and the book API to send value to the database.We will call the rest endpoint “https://localhost:8080/allbooks” or https://localhost:8080/bookbyid/id  to search for a particular book or all books in the database.

Implementing add to favorite feature: When  our service is ready to make an api call and list the data, users can simply add all the favorites books in the store to the favorite part.

Implementing delete from favorite list feature: When  the user wants to delete a particular book from favorite list then the user can remove it by deleting it.
